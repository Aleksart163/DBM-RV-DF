[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/compare/10.2.23...10.2.24) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Retail/releases)

- prep new tags  
- Fix target scanning so it only filters the active tank and not ALL of them. was already fixing this when https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-Unified/pull/432 came through but this supercedes it cause it fixes it in more spots  
- Update localization.ru.lua (#430)  
- Update localization.es.lua (#429)  
- Update koKR (#431)  
- Fix journals description collapsing.  
- update expression  
- Fix last? we want it to ignore spellId, which will be nil more often than not. it's just args 1 and 2 in the \"start\" object this should show  
- Add combo timer object  
- Update localization.tw.lua (#993)  
- Add simple boss health info frame (#428)  
- fix stats errors in follower dungeons  
- Modernize and improve GetUnitIdFromCID a bit to be uniform with it's counterpart GetUnitIdFromGUID Also moved them together so they're not existing in two totally separate areas of core. Even moved the deprecated GetBossUnitId to same area  
- Add simple boss health info frame Displays the boss health that DBM keeps track of anyways. Can only be used for creature IDs that are explicitly registered for the mod  
- deDE update (#427)  
- update version check  
- Update localization.tw.lua (#426)  
- Update koKR (#425)  
- why is this still using checkout v1, update to v4  
- another fix  
- add an emphasized soak warning to melee for flora as well  
- Short text for flora on nymue so it's consistent with other mods. (ie "Red soaks")  
- prune world events from retail  
- Bump classic era version  
- refactor tank swap automation on council to hopefully be more robust in both preventing more than one stack of claws AND still not let same tank get trampled twice in a row. This may be buggy and i won't get to test it until next tuesday
