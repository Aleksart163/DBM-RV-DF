# <DBM RV Mod> Raids (DF)

## [10.2.35](https://github.com/Aleksart163/DBM-RV-DF) (2024-04-15)
[Full Changelog](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/compare/10.2.34...10.2.35) [Previous Releases](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DeadlyBossMods/releases)

- prep new tag to fix cataclysm and retail errors with a new object introduced in cataclysm mod revamps  
- Clear up some LuaLS errors on globals in Core  
- Remove DontShowPTCountdownText since in 10.2.7 and 4.4.0, disabling that text no longer will be possible since we'll use blizzards own countdown timer. To do so would require tainting blizzards countdown function, which we no longer want to do.
